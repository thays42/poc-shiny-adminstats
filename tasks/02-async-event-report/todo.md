# Task 02: Async Event Report

## Problem Definition
Currently, when the event report modal is opened, the `get_event_counts()` function is called synchronously, which can block the UI if the database query takes time. We need to implement asynchronous loading with proper loading states and cancellation handling.

## Requirements
- When `input$event_report` occurs, call `get_event_counts` asynchronously
- Show a busy/loading indicator until `event_data` is defined
- Display statistics when data is loaded (same as current behavior)
- Cancel the asynchronous call if modal is closed before completion

## Implementation Plan

### [x] Task 1: Set up async infrastructure
**Input**: Current synchronous implementation
**Output**: Async-capable structure with promises/future
**Constraints**: Must use Shiny-compatible async approach (promises package)
**Assumptions**: promises package is available or can be added to dependencies
**Completed**: Added promises and future libraries, set up multisession plan

### [x] Task 2: Create loading state management
**Input**: Modal trigger event
**Output**: Reactive values to track loading state and data
**Constraints**: Must handle both loading and loaded states
**Assumptions**: Modal can be updated dynamically
**Completed**: Created reactiveValues with loading, event_data, modal_open, and current_promise tracking

### [x] Task 3: Implement loading UI with busy indicator
**Input**: Loading state reactive
**Output**: Modal with loading spinner/gif
**Constraints**: Should be visually clear that data is loading
**Assumptions**: Shiny has built-in loading indicators or we can use HTML/CSS
**Completed**: Added CSS-animated loading spinner with "Loading event data..." message

### [x] Task 4: Make get_event_counts async
**Input**: Current synchronous `get_event_counts()` function
**Output**: Promise-based version that doesn't block UI
**Constraints**: Must return same data structure as current function
**Assumptions**: Database operations can be wrapped in promises
**Completed**: Created get_event_counts_async() using future_promise wrapper

### [x] Task 5: Handle async data resolution
**Input**: Promise resolution from async `get_event_counts`
**Output**: Updated modal content with statistics
**Constraints**: Must maintain same display format as current implementation
**Assumptions**: Modal content can be updated after initial display
**Completed**: Added observer to update modal content when data loads, maintaining same statistics format

### [x] Task 6: Implement cancellation logic
**Input**: Modal close event
**Output**: Cancelled promise and cleanup
**Constraints**: Must prevent memory leaks and unnecessary processing
**Assumptions**: Promises can be cancelled or their results ignored
**Completed**: Added modal_open flag checking in promise resolution to ignore results if modal closed

### [x] Task 7: Error handling
**Input**: Potential database errors or promise rejections
**Output**: User-friendly error messages in modal
**Constraints**: Should not crash the app
**Assumptions**: Errors can be caught and displayed gracefully
**Completed**: Added promise error handling with user-friendly error display in modal

### [x] Task 8: Testing
**Input**: Completed implementation
**Output**: Verified functionality for all scenarios
**Constraints**: Must test loading, success, error, and cancellation cases
**Assumptions**: Manual testing is acceptable for this scope
**Completed**: All unit tests and integration tests pass. Created comprehensive test suite including async function testing, single modal with shinyjs transitions, state management simulation, cancellation logic with UI reset, and error handling in verbatimTextOutput.

## Technical Notes
- Uses the `promises` package for async operations
- Added `future` package for background processing with multisession plan
- Added `shinyjs` package for smooth show/hide UI element transitions
- Loading indicator is a CSS-animated spinner with "Loading event data..." message (loading_spinner ID)
- Data displayed in verbatimTextOutput element (event_data_output ID)
- Single modal with element transitions instead of multiple modal replacements
- Cancellation handled by tracking modal_open state and ignoring resolved promises if modal is closed
- UI elements properly reset for next use (spinner shown, output hidden)

## Implementation Summary
âœ… **TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

### Key Features Implemented:
1. **Async Database Calls**: `get_event_counts_async()` using `future_promise()` wrapper
2. **Single Modal with shinyjs Transitions**: Loading spinner and hidden verbatimTextOutput with smooth show/hide transitions
3. **Element-based UI Updates**: shinyjs show/hide instead of modal replacement
4. **Cancellation Support**: Promise results ignored if modal closed before completion, with proper UI reset
5. **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages in verbatimTextOutput format
6. **State Management**: Reactive values track loading, data, and modal states
7. **Text Output Format**: Formatted event statistics in verbatimTextOutput element

### Files Modified:
- `app.R`: Main implementation with shinyjs-based async functionality
- `test_async_event_report.R`: Unit tests for all components including shinyjs elements
- `integration_test.R`: Comprehensive integration testing for single modal approach
- `demo.R`: Updated demonstration script for shinyjs implementation
- `SUMMARY.md`: Complete implementation summary with shinyjs details

### Testing Results:
- âœ… All unit tests pass
- âœ… All integration tests pass
- âœ… App loads without syntax errors
- âœ… Ready for manual user testing

## ðŸŽ‰ FINAL IMPLEMENTATION STATUS
**âœ… SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED WITH ENHANCED SHINYJS APPROACH**

The async event report functionality is now fully implemented and tested using a superior single-modal approach with shinyjs transitions!
