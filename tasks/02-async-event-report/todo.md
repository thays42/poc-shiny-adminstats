# Task 02: Async Event Report

## Problem Definition
Currently, when the event report modal is opened, the `get_event_counts()` function is called synchronously, which can block the UI if the database query takes time. We need to implement asynchronous loading with proper loading states and cancellation handling.

## Requirements
- When `input$event_report` occurs, call `get_event_counts` asynchronously
- Show a busy/loading indicator until `event_data` is defined
- Display statistics when data is loaded (same as current behavior)
- Cancel the asynchronous call if modal is closed before completion

## Implementation Plan

### [x] Task 1: Set up async infrastructure
**Input**: Current synchronous implementation
**Output**: Async-capable structure with promises/future
**Constraints**: Must use Shiny-compatible async approach (promises package)
**Assumptions**: promises package is available or can be added to dependencies
**Completed**: Added promises and future libraries, set up multisession plan

### [x] Task 2: Create loading state management
**Input**: Modal trigger event
**Output**: Reactive values to track loading state and data
**Constraints**: Must handle both loading and loaded states
**Assumptions**: Modal can be updated dynamically
**Completed**: Created reactiveValues with loading, event_data, modal_open, and current_promise tracking

### [x] Task 3: Implement loading UI with busy indicator
**Input**: Loading state reactive
**Output**: Modal with loading spinner/gif
**Constraints**: Should be visually clear that data is loading
**Assumptions**: Shiny has built-in loading indicators or we can use HTML/CSS
**Completed**: Added CSS-animated loading spinner with "Loading event data..." message

### [x] Task 4: Make get_event_counts async
**Input**: Current synchronous `get_event_counts()` function
**Output**: Promise-based version that doesn't block UI
**Constraints**: Must return same data structure as current function
**Assumptions**: Database operations can be wrapped in promises
**Completed**: Created get_event_counts_async() using future_promise wrapper

### [x] Task 5: Handle async data resolution
**Input**: Promise resolution from async `get_event_counts`
**Output**: Updated modal content with statistics
**Constraints**: Must maintain same display format as current implementation
**Assumptions**: Modal content can be updated after initial display
**Completed**: Added observer to update modal content when data loads, maintaining same statistics format

### [x] Task 6: Implement cancellation logic
**Input**: Modal close event
**Output**: Cancelled promise and cleanup
**Constraints**: Must prevent memory leaks and unnecessary processing
**Assumptions**: Promises can be cancelled or their results ignored
**Completed**: Added modal_open flag checking in promise resolution to ignore results if modal closed

### [x] Task 7: Error handling
**Input**: Potential database errors or promise rejections
**Output**: User-friendly error messages in modal
**Constraints**: Should not crash the app
**Assumptions**: Errors can be caught and displayed gracefully
**Completed**: Added promise error handling with user-friendly error display in modal

### [x] Task 8: Testing
**Input**: Completed implementation
**Output**: Verified functionality for all scenarios
**Constraints**: Must test loading, success, error, and cancellation cases
**Assumptions**: Manual testing is acceptable for this scope
**Completed**: All unit tests and integration tests pass. Created comprehensive test suite including async function testing, modal content verification, state management simulation, cancellation logic, and error handling.

## Technical Notes
- Uses the `promises` package for async operations
- Added `future` package for background processing with multisession plan
- Loading indicator is a CSS-animated spinner with "Loading event data..." message
- Cancellation handled by tracking modal_open state and ignoring resolved promises if modal is closed

## Implementation Summary
✅ **TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

### Key Features Implemented:
1. **Async Database Calls**: `get_event_counts_async()` using `future_promise()` wrapper
2. **Loading States**: Loading spinner shown immediately when modal opens
3. **Dynamic Modal Updates**: Modal content updates when async data resolves
4. **Cancellation Support**: Promise results ignored if modal closed before completion
5. **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages for database failures
6. **State Management**: Reactive values track loading, data, and modal states

### Files Modified:
- `app.R`: Main implementation with async functionality
- `test_async_event_report.R`: Unit tests for all components
- `integration_test.R`: Comprehensive integration testing

### Testing Results:
- ✅ All unit tests pass
- ✅ All integration tests pass
- ✅ App loads without syntax errors
- ✅ Ready for manual user testing

The async event report functionality is now fully implemented and tested!
