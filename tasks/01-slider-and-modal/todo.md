# Task Plan: Shiny Application UI Updates

## Problem Statement
Update the existing Shiny application to improve the user interface by:
1. Adding a navbar with application title and navigation menu
2. Moving the event report functionality to a nav menu item
3. Adding a sample size slider and reorganizing the layout

## Tasks

### Task 1: Update UI structure to use navbar layout
- [x] Replace current UI with `navbarPage()` instead of `fluidPage()`
- [x] Set application title to "tool"
- [x] Create main panel titled "main"
- **Inputs**: Current `fluidPage()` UI structure
- **Outputs**: New `navbarPage()` structure with title "tool"
- **Constraints**: Must maintain existing functionality

### Task 2: Add navigation menu with "Usage" item
- [x] Remove the "Show Event Report" button from sidebar
- [x] Add right-aligned nav menu to navbar
- [x] Create "Usage" menu item that triggers the modal
- **Inputs**: Current button-based modal trigger
- **Outputs**: Nav menu item that opens the same modal
- **Constraints**: Modal content and functionality must remain identical

### Task 3: Add sample size slider
- [x] Create slider input with range 1-10,000, default 1,000
- [x] Update histogram generation to use slider value instead of fixed 1,000
- [x] Test that slider works with different sample sizes
- **Inputs**: Fixed sample size of 1,000
- **Outputs**: Variable sample size controlled by slider
- **Constraints**: Slider range 1-10,000, default 1,000

### Task 4: Reorganize layout
- [x] Move slider and generate button below the plot
- [x] Arrange slider and button side by side
- [x] Ensure responsive layout on different screen sizes
- **Inputs**: Current sidebar layout
- **Outputs**: New layout with controls below plot
- **Constraints**: Controls must be side by side and below plot

### Task 5: Update server logic
- [x] Modify histogram generation to use `input$sample_size`
- [x] Update event logging to work with new UI structure
- [x] Test that all functionality works with new layout
- **Inputs**: Server logic using fixed sample size
- **Outputs**: Server logic using dynamic sample size from slider
- **Constraints**: All existing functionality must be preserved

### Task 6: Testing
- [x] Test navbar and navigation functionality
- [x] Test sample size slider with various values
- [x] Test event logging and reporting modal
- [x] Verify layout responsiveness
- **Inputs**: Updated application
- **Outputs**: Verified working application
- **Constraints**: All original features must work correctly

## Completion Summary

All tasks have been completed successfully:

✅ **UI Structure Updated**: Changed from `fluidPage()` to `navbarPage()` with title "tool" and main panel "main"

✅ **Navigation Menu**: Added right-aligned "Usage" menu that triggers the event report modal instead of a button

✅ **Sample Size Slider**: Added slider with range 1-10,000, default 1,000, fully integrated with histogram generation

✅ **Layout Reorganization**: Moved controls below the plot, arranged slider and button side by side using Bootstrap grid

✅ **Server Logic Updated**: Modified to use `input$sample_size` for dynamic sample sizes and updated event logging

✅ **Comprehensive Testing**: Created and ran test suites that verify all functionality works correctly

## Implementation Details

- **Navbar Implementation**: Used `navbarPage()` with custom JavaScript to handle the Usage menu click
- **Responsive Layout**: Used Bootstrap's `fluidRow()` and `column()` system for responsive design
- **Dynamic Titles**: Histogram title updates to reflect current sample size
- **Event Logging**: All original database functionality preserved and working
- **Testing**: Created comprehensive test suites covering UI structure, slider functionality, and database operations

All original features have been maintained while successfully implementing the requested UI improvements.

## Assumptions
- The database functionality and event logging should remain unchanged
- The histogram generation logic only needs to accept variable sample size
- The modal content and styling can remain the same
- Bootstrap styling should be maintained for consistency
